# NYC Taxi Trips-Fabric Project

## Overview

In this project we will orchestrate the movement of NYC taxi Trips raw data, starting from landing data into lakehouse to creating semantic models and visualizations using cleaned, transformaed data from data warehouse.

Dataset includes following fields: pickup and drop-off dates/times, pickup and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts (check data dictionary for more details).
